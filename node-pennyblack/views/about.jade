                    | I wanted to see if a software program could
                    | detect the printing press used to create a penny
                    | black stamp.

                    | This website would not be possible without the
                    | work of P.C. Litchfield's 'Guide Lines to the Penny Black'
                    | and I would recommend that as a valuable aid in plating the
                    | penny black.
